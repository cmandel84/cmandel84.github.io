        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Howdy! My name is <strong>Cade Mandel</strong>, and I’m a junior at Texas A&M University pursuing a degree in Management Information Systems and a minor in Artificial Intelligence in Business. I’m passionate about data-driven decision making, project management, and leveraging AI to improve business efficiency.</p>

        <!-- BRAY INTERNATIONAL CARD -->
        <div class="card">
          <div style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="images/BrayLogo.jpg" alt="Bray International Logo" style="width: 160px; margin-bottom: 15px; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 3px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">

          <h3>Information Technology & Data Analytics Intern — Bray International, Inc.</h3>
          <p>During my internship at Bray International in Houston, I developed a proof of concept for cost accounting analysis across global manufacturing and purchasing operations. This project was designed to identify costing anomalies across product families and improve cost transparency within the company’s worldwide operations.</p>
          <p>I designed and published an interactive Power BI dashboard integrated with the company’s inventory data cube to visualize live key costing data. The dashboard dynamically prioritized groups based on their potential cost impact, considering on-hand inventory and purchasing history. Through this analysis, I uncovered a case in the U.S. operations where on-hand inventory was overvalued by approximately $700,000.</p>
          <p>The proof of concept gained significant attention and was officially adopted by the company’s IT development team, evolving into a live production application. The system is now actively used by Bray’s operations teams across multiple global divisions, including facilities in China and India. This experience deepened my understanding of business intelligence, global collaboration, and data-driven problem-solving.</p>

          <h3>Vice President of Finance — Sigma Phi Epsilon, Texas Mu Chapter</h3>
          <p>As Vice President of Finance for the Texas Mu Chapter of Sigma Phi Epsilon at Texas A&M University, I oversee the chapter’s financial operations and budgeting. I chair a budget committee responsible for managing approximately $240,000 in annual revenue and expenses, ensuring accurate financial planning and responsible allocation of resources.</p>
          <p>My responsibilities include preparing monthly accounting and financial reports that track actual-to-budget variances, managing member dues collections, and coordinating payment plans for active members. I also present financial results and updates at monthly alumni executive board meetings, facilitating transparent communication between undergraduate leadership and alumni advisors.</p>
          <p>This leadership role has strengthened my skills in financial analysis, reporting, and strategic decision-making. It has also given me hands-on experience with organizational management and accountability—skills I plan to continue developing as I pursue a career that blends business management with data analytics and technology.</p>

      <!-- AI SHOWCASE SECTION -->
<section class="ai-showcase">
  <h2>AI Media Showcase — "Aggie Innovation"</h2>
  <p>
    This section highlights my exploration of artificial intelligence in creative media. 
    Using Google’s <strong>Imagen Nano</strong> (Nano Banana), I generated a concept artwork titled 
    <em>"Aggie Innovation"</em> — a digital representation of how technology and tradition can merge. 
    The design symbolizes <strong>Texas A&M University’s</strong> commitment to innovation, 
    featuring maroon circuit patterns and futuristic digital lines that form the A&M logo, 
    reflecting the intersection of data, design, and Aggie spirit.

  </figure>

  <p>
    This project demonstrates my interest in how AI tools like Imagen Nano and Veo can be integrated into 
    business, design, and analytics to enhance storytelling and visual communication. 
    It represents the creative potential of machine learning models when applied to branding and identity within a digital context.
